**Witless Database Migrations**

*As in, these migrations know no ORM.*

Initial version of this.  For now you'd install by copying "current" and "upgrade" into
a schema directory within your project heirarchy and create sql files within that 
directory.

At the moment this is just the two scripts referenced in 
[this stack overflow comment](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35047/migrating-database-changes-from-development-to-live/3488657#3488657) 
but I'm putting this here with the intent to improve it.
